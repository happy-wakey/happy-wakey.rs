# Happy Wakey Documentation

This directory documents the product and the implementation in:

`/Users/maca5/codes/happy-wakey/happy-wakey.rs`

The documents describe the code as it exists on August 22, 2026. Planned features are labeled explicitly so they are not confused with shipped behavior.

## Short Answer

Happy Wakey is a native desktop application, not a browser shell. Rust owns application state, configuration, authentication, network calls, and service integration. Qt 6 Quick/QML renders the interface. `cxx-qt` generates the typed bridge between Rust and Qt. Qt WebEngine is used only for the in-app browser panel.

The architecture is cross-platform across macOS, Windows, and Linux because Rust, Qt 6, QML, CXX-Qt, Reqwest, and Qt WebEngine support those platforms. The application must still be compiled and packaged separately on each target operating system because it links to that platform's Qt runtime and native windowing stack.

The current repository builds and runs on macOS. Production installers, signing, notarization, Windows/Linux release validation, native notification support, and automatic Git backup are still roadmap items.
